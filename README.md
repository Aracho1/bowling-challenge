### Approach
* TDD using Jasmine
* Used pure Javascript

### Challenges & to Improve
* Initially wanted to break down the classes to game, score and frame but had difficulties so everything is in one class (area of improvement)
* It was challenging to adapt the source code to fit the interface - to keep in mind user interface when starting planning
* Interface code needs to be cleaned up
* Inaccurate scores for edge cases, especially in the bonus round
